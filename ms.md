## Abstract

## Motivation

The basic process of writing a scientific documents hasn't changed much in the
last few hundred years. A document is written and submitted to a small
committee that will evaluate its content and make suggestions. Unfortunately,
the process is slow and done behind closed doors. There are faster, and more
open, ways to develop and evaluate documents. Modern software engineers rely on
a sophisticated, and well studied, methodology for developing documents (source
code) and rigorously review and improve them. Software engineers have to write
thousands of lines of code in coordination, detect errors in the code (bugs),
and fix them. This process is essentially the same as the scientific process.

* Discuss revision control & bug tracking.
* Git in science [@ram2013].
* Git/Mercurial/Bazaar are decentralizied (which is good)...
* ...what we need is a tool to track the repositories.
* Scriptoria offers a single API/WUI to track repositories with manuscripts.

## Box 1: Questions/Answers

* What are git, mercurial, bazaar?
* Where can I store repositories?
* What is a clone, a fork?

## Description

### Website

A basic description of how the website works.

* Users add repositories with a scriptoria.json file at the root.
* The website stores the info and track the repository (e.g.: last activity, DOI, etc...).
* Users can browse the repositories via the web user interface.
* Developpers can build tools using scriptoria's RESTful API.

### Format

To be included in Sciptoria's database, a repository must have a file named
scriptoria.json (all in lowercase) at its root (Box 2). JSON is a common
human-readable format used for (well everything...).  A basic JSON file for
scriptoria will have the following entries: **source** establishes the address
of the original repository for the article. It is used to avoid confusion if
the repository is cloned or forked. **type** is one of: 'article', 'thesis',
'book', 'book chapter', 'conference'. **status** is either 'published' or 'in
preparation'.  If this entry is not set, it will default to 'in preparation',
unless a doi is provided, in which case it will always be set to 'published'.
**title** and **abstract** are also mandatory and each are represented by a
single string. **authors** is an array of maps, i.e.: it must be enclosed by
squared brackets and contains information on each author within brackets. For
each author, the **first name**, **last name**, and **email** entries must be
provided. Scriptoria.info has a formal description of the JSON format along
with a validator: URL (a simple tool to write scriptoria.json files perhaps?).

## Box 2: Sample JSON file

``` json
{
  "source": "https://github.com/karthikram/smb_git",
  "type": "ms",
  "status": "published",
  "title": "Git: A powerful tool to facilitate greater reproducibility and
transparency in science",
  "abstract": "Git is a powerful version control system that is widely used in
software development. The features of Git that make it popular among software
developers also makes it ideal for managing research workflows. In this article
I describe how the power of Git could be leveraged in a scientific context to
improve reproduciblity, increase transparency, and make it easy for others to
build upon existing work. I also provide a handful of real-world use cases
describing how Git and Git hosting services such as GitHub can enhance
collaborative efforts, lower barriers to data re-use, and accelerate
development of new ideas.",

## Discussion

* The discussion should focus on applications of the API, and how it could be intergrated in science [@ram2013].
