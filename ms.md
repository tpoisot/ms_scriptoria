## Abstract

## Motivation

* How software development works and why it offers a better and more open system.
* Git in science [@ram2013].
* Git/Mercurial/Bazaar are decentralizied (which is good)...
* ...what we need is a tool to track the repositories.
* Scriptoria offers a single API/WUI to track repositories with manuscripts.

## Box 1: Questions/Answers

A few questions and answers for people with little knowledge of git, github, et
al. If we refer to actual software, it should work on major platforms (Linux,
Windows, OSX I guess...).

## Description

### Website

A basic description of how the website works.

* Users add repositories with a scriptoria.json file at the root.
* The website stores the info and track the repository (e.g.: last activity, DOI, etc...).
* Users can browse the repositories via the web user interface.
* Developpers can build tools using scriptoria's RESTful API.

### Format

A very basic description of the format, but it would be better to redirect the readers to the
website for up-to-date info. However, the JSON format to include in the repositories should be
simple and very stable, so it could be described here.

* Description of the JSON format used to add repositories to sciptoria.info.
* The API, along with examples and tutorial, are available on the website (not described here).

## Discussion

The discussion should focus on applications of the API, and how it could be intergrated in 
science [@ram2013].
